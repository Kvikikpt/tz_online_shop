Before starting the server make an `.env` file from `env.exmple`

To start the server run `docker compose up` command

Admin user will be created automatically, login password from env,
you cannot create admin from the server api

To get documentation, go to http://localhost:80 after starting the server

To run a couple of tests first you need to run `npm install` command, then `npm t`

I was not implementing all tests for 100% coverage to save time.
